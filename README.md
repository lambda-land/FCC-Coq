# Formula Choice Calculus

This repository accompanies a paper currently under review by [Spencer
Hubbard][Spencer] and [Eric Walkingshaw][Eric]. 

The formula choice calculus (FCC) is a generalization of the choice calculus
that allows choices to be labeled by propositional formulas rather than atomic
dimensions.

The paper presents an equivalence relation on FCC terms. This repository
provides a mechanized proof that any two terms related by the equivalence
relation have the same semantics.
